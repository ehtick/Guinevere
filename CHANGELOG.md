# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased][]

## v[5.4.0][] 2026-10-01

## v[5.3.0][] 2026-09-29

- Fixed: A drag source declared with an `object` payload carries it under its own type, so typed `DropTarget<T>` accept it. Tree rows could previously only be dropped on `DropTarget<object>`.
- Fixed: A left click on a tree row settles when the button comes up, so a press that goes on to be a drag no longer selects the row. Added `InteractableElement.OnClickCompleted`; `TreeViewTheme.DragThreshold` tunes the distance that separates the two.
- Changed: Standardized release workflow and target names with Turian.

## v[5.2.0][] 2026-09-28

## v[5.1.0][] 2026-09-27

- Fixed: Text fields keep the caret after edits; double-click selects words around punctuation and triple-click selects all.
- Changed: Simplified stylesheet application and intrinsic sizing; reduced hot-path allocations with benchmark coverage.
- Tests: rendering paths and reducing the top "CRAP" score.
- Added: `RegisterFocusable(claimsArrowKeys:)`; tree views keep focus on arrow keys instead of also moving it.
- Fixed: Text fields keep arrow keys for caret movement; tree row text stays readable when selected.
- Added: Vulkan Silk.NET hosts can veto a window close.

## v[5.0.0][] 2026-09-26

- Breaking: `BeginFrame` and `DrawText` changed parameters, changing their CLR signatures; recompile consumers when upgrading.
- Added: Composable min/max layout expressions and Font Awesome widget icons alongside Noto Emoji fallback.
- Changed: Window integrations configure fonts once; `BeginFrame(canvas)` reuses them, and Vulkan render failures now surface.
- Changed: Wrapped text layout now lives in core and is shared with ordinary text drawing.

## v[4.2.0][] 2026-09-25

## v[4.1.0][] 2026-09-23

- Fixed: Text area caret was never drawn (its node was built only in the render pass)
- Fixed: Scrollbar thumbs show the default cursor instead of their container's
- Added: DOM-style event propagation, node cursor shapes, and hidden/relative/wrapped pointer modes
- Changed: `gui.Input` filters edges handled with `PreventDefault`; use `gui.PlatformInput` for the raw handler
- Removed: `PointerCursor.Hidden`; request `PointerMode.Hidden` instead
- Added: Capability-based platform services and integration conformance checks
- Added: Headless press, toggle, selection, drag, and repeat behaviors with optional control semantics
- Fixed: Tab and dropdown state changes now happen between frames, preventing new trees from blinking before layout
- Added: File browser widget
- Changed: Major rework on some internal type representations, specially Color
- Changed: Enhanced the Drag-and-drop API
- Added: Better styling foundations and showcase
- Changed: Standardized Excalibur control palettes and sizes
- Changed: Excalibur defaults now use independently inheritable style values
- Removed: Obsolete untyped drop targets and single-term unit accessors

## v[4.0.0][] 2026-09-20

### Added

- **Composable layouts:** Mix and interpolate pixels, percentages, ratios, expand, fit-content, and the new `FitLargest` sizing via `UnitValue`.
- **Layout caching:** Added explicit dirty tracking and invalidation for retained layout trees.
- **Docs & Benchmarks:** Added layout performance/migration docs and `Example-90-LayoutBenchmarks`.

### Changed

- **Performance overhaul:** Intrinsic layout measurement is now a bottom-up, linear pass. It allocates zero memory in steady state.
- **Optimizations:** Replaced LINQ with direct loops/reusable buffers, added single-child fast paths, and streamlined scroll offset propagation.

### Breaking Changes

- **Value types:** `Rect` is now a `record struct`. `UnitValue` and `LayoutStyle` have new binary layouts.
- **API removals:** Dropped the `UnitValue(UnitType, float)` constructor and its implicit numeric conversions.
- **Manual invalidation:** Directly writing to a retained `LayoutNode.Style` now requires an explicit `InvalidateLayout()` call (fluent APIs handle this automatically).

#### Upgrade Guide

- Replace null `Rect` references with `Rect?`.
- Build `UnitValue`s using factory methods (e.g., `UnitValue.Pixels`, `UnitValue.FitLargest`) and read final numeric results directly from the calculated node rectangle.
- Call `node.InvalidateLayout()` after mutating style fields directly.
- Recompile any projects referencing `Rect`, `UnitValue`, or `LayoutStyle` to account for structural changes.

## v[3.1.0][] 2026-09-19

- Added: Dialogs

- Fixed: ApplyAncestorClips' content overflow

## v[3.0.0][] 2026-09-18

- Breaking CHANGE: integrations namespaces now use only `Guinevere`
- Fix: avoid embedding duplicate fonts (icons.ttf is a duplicate of NotoColorEmoji-Regular.ttf)
- Change: removal of `DrawTick`, `DrawSubmenuArrow` and `DrawTriangleFilled` in favor of icons/emojis

## v[2.1.0][] 2026-09-17

## v[1.7.0][] 2026-09-11

- Added: docking system (`Guinevere/Docking/`, sample `Sample-60-Docking`) — `DockLayout` with tab
  groups, nested splits and floating windows, rendered by `gui.DockSpace(...)`, with drag-to-dock,
  tab reorder, tear-off and close
- Added: draggable borders — `gui.Splitter(ref fraction, axis)` resizes the two flow siblings it
  separates
- Added: out-of-flow positioning (`LayoutNode.Absolute` / `AbsoluteScreen`) and `BlockInput()` for
  overlays
- Added: input simulator
